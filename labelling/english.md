- Now, when you double-click the item on the left menu, it will be automatically connected and the program will run.

## How to label

The labeling we are going to do this time (marking the correct answer on the image) is to store the object as a rectangular area.

- The target objects are as follows.
    
    
    | target | object label | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | monitor | monitor | One for a single monitor, and one for more than two monitors |
    | hand | hand | If both hands are located separately, indicate each, if overlapped, indicate only one |
    | Books on desk | book | Except for books on the bookshelf |
    | Handwritten notes on desk | notebook | |
    | Post-it | notepad | |
- Points to note when working
    - If none of the above items are found, it will be skipped.

### Labeling order

- Click the ‘OpenDir’ button on the left to open the image folder.
    - The image folder consists of the worker's email ID.

    - Select `Edit` - `Create Rectangle` from the top menu.

    - Now double-click to select the object mentioned above as a square box. After that, enter the value corresponding to the `object label` in the table above. Here, you have selected a hand, so enter hand. (**From the second time on, you just have to select it.**) In the same way, if you see the objects in the table above, check them all.
        
        **If you do it quickly, you may make a lot of mistakes, so be careful!**
